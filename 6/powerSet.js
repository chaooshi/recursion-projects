/*
Power Set: Finding All Subsets of a Set

The power set of a set is the set of every possible subset of that set. For
example, the power set of {A, B, C} is {{ }, {A}, {B}, {C}, {A, B}, {A, C}, {B, C},
{A, B, C}}.

To find every power set of a set, we could reuse our existing getCombos()
function, calling it repeatedly with each possible k argument. 

However, we can use a more efficient way to generate power sets. Letâ€™s
consider the power set of {A, B}, which is {{A, B}, {A}, {B}, { }}. Now say we
add one more element, C, to the set and want to generate the power set
of {A, B, C}. We have the four sets in the power set of {A, B} we already generated; in addition, we have these same four sets but with the element C
added to them: {{A, B, C}, {A, C}, {B, C}, {C}}.
